Hello!

This is my first repository thing in GitHub

I have made this code back in late 2023 for my College Computing project, it contains OOP, a whole bunch of IF statements and much more.
Sorry, but I forgot which version I made this code on, but it should work with most newer versions, but have to change a few things though, so be prepared to edit my work for your benefit!

have a nice rest of your day!
